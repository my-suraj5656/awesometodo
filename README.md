Overview of the Project

MERN Task Management App Project
Objective
The objective of this project is to build a Task Management application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by providing features such as task creation, editing, deletion, and status tracking. The goal is to demonstrate full-stack development skills and deliver a seamless user experience.

Key Activities
Backend Development (Node.js & Express.js):

Set up a RESTful API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing tasks.
Integrate MongoDB for storing task-related data.
Implement user authentication and authorization for secure access.
Frontend Development (React.js):

Create a responsive and user-friendly interface using React.js.
Develop components for task management, including adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed.
Manage application state using React Context API or Redux.
Database Integration (MongoDB):

Design a schema to store tasks, including fields for task title, description, status, priority, and due date.
Ensure efficient data handling and retrieval using MongoDB queries.
Additional Features:

Add task filtering and sorting options (e.g., by priority, due date, or status).
Implement a search bar for easy task lookup.
Provide a feature to archive completed tasks.
Deployment:

Host the backend on Render or Heroku.
Deploy the frontend on Netlify or Vercel.
Connect the backend and frontend for a seamless user experience.
